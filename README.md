This macro was developed by Agata Witkowska for the study
Witkowska A. & Jahn R., Biophysical Journal (2017)
"Rapid SNARE-mediated fusion of liposomes and chromaffin granules with giant unilamellar vesicles"

This Fiji macro can be used for automatic detection of GUV on a microscopy image (1 GUV on image present), linearization of its membrane with a polar transformation method, removal of saturated pixels and measurement of peak membrane intensities on a transformed image. It returns GUV diameter, mean membrane peak intensity and std of it.
Required plugin: Polar Transformer.
